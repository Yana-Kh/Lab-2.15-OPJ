Do you like watching cartoons? Probably you do! But how did they come to be? Who invented1 them?

This is actually a very tough question. The first cartoons were created long bef**e the TV.
F** example, shadow play2 w** a very popular f**m of entertainment3 in ancient China
Such shows looked alm*** like modern cartoons!

A toy called a flip book4 w** made in the late 19th century.
It w** a small soft book with pictures. Each picture w** drawn in a slightly different5 way.
When you bend this book and rele**e the pages one by one, the i***es start to move.
Strictly speaking, they don’t, but our eyes see it like that anyway.
The first real cartoons were made using this t****, too!

In 1895 brothers Louis and Auguste Lumière created a cinematograph.
It w** a camera and a film project** in one ***ice.
Using this ***ice, many **piring6 film direct**s started to create their own cartoons.

This ***eloped into a full industry by 1910.
Many cartoons of that era are f**gotten7 now, but some are still with us.
F** example, Felix the Cat w** created by Otto Messmer in 1919, and he’s still with us, m**e than a hundred years later.
Currently the rights8 to the character are held by DreamW**ks Animation.

One of the pioneers9 in the industry w** famous Walt Disney.
He w** not afraid to experiment to make a cartoon, and his Snow White film w** among the firsts to use a multiplane camera.
With its help the characters were able to move around the objects, creating an illusion of a 3D w**ld.

Today m*** of the cartoons are made with computer animation.
The l**t traditional Disney cartoon to date w** Winnie the Pooh (2011).
